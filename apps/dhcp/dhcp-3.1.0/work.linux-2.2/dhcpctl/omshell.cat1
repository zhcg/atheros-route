       The  OMAPI  Command Shell, omshell, provides an interactive way to con-
       nect to, query, and possibly change, the ISC DHCP  Server’s  state  via
       OMAPI,  the  Object Management API.  By using OMAPI and omshell, you do
       not have to stop, make changes, and then restart the DHCP  server,  but
       can  make the changes while the server is running.   Omshell provides a
       way of accessing OMAPI.

       OMAPI is simply a communications mechanism that allows you  to  manipu-
       late  objects.    In order to actually _u_s_e omshell, you _m_u_s_t understand
       what objects are available and how  to  use  them.   Documentation  for
       OMAPI  objects  can  be  found in the documentation for the server that
       provides them - for example,  in  the  ddhhccppdd((11))  manual  page  and  the
       ddhhcclliieenntt((11)) manual page.

       This  software  is free software.  At various times its development has
       been underwritten by various organizations, including the ISC and Vixie
       Enterprises.  The development of 3.0 has been funded almost entirely by
       Nominum, Inc.

       At this point development is being shepherded by Ted Lemon, and  hosted
       by the ISC, but the future of this project depends on you.  If you have
       features you want, please consider implementing them.

       Throughout this document, there are  references  to  local  and  remote
       objects.   Local  objects are ones created in omshell with the nneeww com-
       mand.  Remote objects are ones on the server: leases, hosts, and groups
       that the DHCP server knows about.  Local and remote objects are associ-
       ated together to enable viewing and modification of object  attributes.
       Also, new remote objects can be created to match local objects.

       omshell  is  started  from  the command line.  Once omshell is started,
       there are several commands that can be issued:

       sseerrvveerr _a_d_d_r_e_s_s
            where address is the IP address of the DHCP server to connect  to.
            If  this is not specified, the default server is 127.0.0.1 (local-
            host).

       ppoorrtt _n_u_m_b_e_r
            where number is the port that OMAPI listens on.  By default,  this
            is 7911.

       kkeeyy _n_a_m_e _s_e_c_r_e_t
            This  specifies  the  TSIG  key  to  use to authenticate the OMAPI
            transactions.  _n_a_m_e is the name of a  key  defined  in  _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f
            with the oommaappii--kkeeyy statement.  The _s_e_c_r_e_t is the secret key gener-
            ated from ddnnsssseecc--kkeeyyggeenn or another key generation program.

       ccoonnnneecctt
            This starts the OMAPI connection to the server as specified by the
            _s_e_r_v_e_r statement.

       Any  object  defined in OMAPI can be created, queried, and/or modified.
       The object types  available  to  OMAPI  are  defined  in  ddhhccppdd((88))  and
       ddhhcclliieenntt((88)).   When  using  omshell, objects are first defined locally,
       manipulated as desired, and then  associated  with  an  object  on  the
       server.   Only  one  object  can be manipulated at a time.  To create a
       local object, use

       nneeww _o_b_j_e_c_t_-_t_y_p_e
            _o_b_j_e_c_t_-_t_y_p_e is one of group, host, or lease.

       At this point, you now have an object that you can set  properties  on.
       For example, if a new lease object was created with _n_e_w _l_e_a_s_e, any of a
       lease’s attributes can be set as follows:

       sseett _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_-_n_a_m_e _= _v_a_l_u_e
            AAttttrriibbuuttee names are defined in ddhhccppdd((88)) and  ddhhcclliieenntt((88)).   Values
            should  be  quoted  if  they are strings.  So, to set a lease’s IP
            address, you would do the following:
             sseett iipp--aaddddrreessss == 119922..116688..44..5500

       At this point, you can query the  server  for  information  about  this
       lease, by

       ooppeenn

       Now,  the  local lease object you created and set the IP address for is
       associated with the corresponding lease object on the DHCP server.  All
       of  the  lease  attributes  from  the  DHCP  server  are  now  also the
       attributes on the local object, and will be shown in omshell.

VVIIEEWWIINNGG AA RREEMMOOTTEE OOBBJJEECCTT
       To query a lease of address 192.168.4.50, and find out its  attributes,
       after connecting to the server, take the following steps:

       nneeww lleeaassee

       This creates a new local lease object.

       sseett iipp--aaddddrreessss == 119922..116688..44..5500

       This sets the _l_o_c_a_l object’s IP address to be 192.168.4.50

       ooppeenn

       Now,  if  a  lease  with  that  IP address exists, you will see all the
       information the DHCP server has about that particular lease.  Any  data
       that  isn’t readily printable text will show up in colon-separated hex-
       adecimal values.  In this example, output back from the server for  the
       entire transaction might look like this:

       > new "lease"
       obj: lease
       > set ip-address = 192.168.4.50
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       > open
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       state = 00:00:00:02
       dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       client-hostname = "wendelina"
       subnet = 00:00:00:06
       pool = 00:00:00:07
       hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
       starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
       tstp = 00:00:00:00
       tsfp = 00:00:00:00
       cltt = 00:00:00:00

       As  you  can see here, the IP address is represented in hexadecimal, as
       are the starting and ending times of the lease.

       Attributes of remote objects are updated by using the  sseett  command  as
       before,  and  then issuing an uuppddaattee command.  The sseett command sets the
       attributes on the current local object, and the uuppddaattee  command  pushes
       those changes out to the server.

       Continuing with the previous example, if a sseett cclliieenntt--hhoossttnnaammee == ""ssoommee--
       tthhiinngg--eellssee"" was issued, followed by an uuppddaattee command, the output would
       look about like this:

       > set client-hostname = "something-else"
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       state = 00:00:00:02
       dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       client-hostname = "something-else"
       subnet = 00:00:00:06
       pool = 00:00:00:07
       hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
       starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
       tstp = 00:00:00:00
       tsfp = 00:00:00:00
       cltt = 00:00:00:00
       > update
       obj: lease
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:32
       state = 00:00:00:02
       dhcp-client-identifier = 01:00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       client-hostname = "something-else"
       subnet = 00:00:00:06
       pool = 00:00:00:07
       hardware-address = 00:10:a4:b2:36:2c
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ends = dc:d9:0d:3b
       starts = 5c:9f:04:3b
       tstp = 00:00:00:00
       tsfp = 00:00:00:00
       cltt = 00:00:00:00

NNEEWW RREEMMOOTTEE OOBBJJEECCTTSS
       New  remote  objects  are  created  much  in the same way that existing
       server objects are modified.  Create a local object using nneeww, set  the
       attributes  as you’d wish them to be, and then create the remote object
       with the same properties by using

       ccrreeaattee

       Now a new object exists on the DHCP server which matches the properties
       that  you  gave your local object.  Objects created via OMAPI are saved
       into the dhcpd.leases file.

       For example, if a new host with the IP address of 192.168.4.40 needs to
       be created it would be done as follows:

       > new host
       obj: host
       > set name = "some-host"
       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       > set hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       > set hardware-type = 1
       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 1
       > set ip-address = 192.168.4.40
       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 1
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       > create
       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       >

       Your dhcpd.leases file would then have an entry like this in it:

       host some-host {
         dynamic;
         hardware ethernet 00:80:c7:84:b1:94;
         fixed-address 192.168.4.40;
       }

       The  _d_y_n_a_m_i_c_;  line is to denote that this host entry did not come from
       dhcpd.conf, but was created dynamically via OMAPI.

RREESSEETTTTIINNGG AATTTTRRIIBBUUTTEESS
       If you want to remove an attribute from an object, you can do this with
       the uunnsseett command.   Once you have unset an attribute, you must use the
       uuppddaattee command to update the remote object.  So,  if  the  host  "some-
       host"  from the previous example will not have a static IP address any-
       more, the commands in omshell would look like this:

       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       > unset ip-address
       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = <null>
       >

RREEFFRREESSHHIINNGG OOBBJJEECCTTSS
       A local object may be refreshed with the current remote object  proper-
       ties  using the rreeffrreesshh command.  This is useful for object that change
       periodically, like leases, to see if  they  have  been  updated.   This
       isn’t particularly useful for hosts.

DDEELLEETTIINNGG OOBBJJEECCTTSS
       Any  remote  object that can be created can also be destroyed.  This is
       done by creating a new local object,  setting  attributes,  associating
       the  local and remote object using ooppeenn, and then using the rreemmoovvee com-
       mand.  If the host "some-host" from before was created in  error,  this
       could be corrected as follows:

       obj: host
       name = "some-host"
       hardware-address = 00:80:c7:84:b1:94
       hardware-type = 00:00:00:01
       ip-address = c0:a8:04:28
       > remove
       obj: <null>
