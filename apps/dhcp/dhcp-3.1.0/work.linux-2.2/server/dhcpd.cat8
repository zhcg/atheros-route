       The  Internet  Systems  Consortium  DHCP  Server, dhcpd, implements the
       Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and the  Internet  Bootstrap
       Protocol (BOOTP).  DHCP allows hosts on a TCP/IP network to request and
       be assigned IP addresses, and also to discover  information  about  the
       network to which they are attached.  BOOTP provides similar functional-
       ity, with certain restrictions.

CCOONNTTRRIIBBUUTTIIOONNSS
       This software is free software.  At various times its  development  has
       been underwritten by various organizations, including the ISC and Vixie
       Enterprises.  The development of 3.0 has been funded almost entirely by
       Nominum, Inc.

       At  this point development is being shepherded by Ted Lemon, and hosted
       by the ISC, but the future of this project depends on you.  If you have
       features you want, please consider implementing them.

OOPPEERRAATTIIOONN
       The  DHCP protocol allows a host which is unknown to the network admin-
       istrator to be automatically assigned a new IP address out of a pool of
       IP  addresses for its network.   In order for this to work, the network
       administrator allocates address pools in each subnet  and  enters  them
       into the dhcpd.conf(5) file.

       On startup, dhcpd reads the _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f file and stores a list of avail-
       able addresses on each subnet in memory.  When  a  client  requests  an
       address  using  the  DHCP  protocol, dhcpd allocates an address for it.
       Each client is assigned a lease, which expires after an amount of  time
       chosen  by  the  administrator  (by  default,  one day).  Before leases
       expire, the clients to which leases are assigned are expected to  renew
       them  in  order  to  continue  to  use the addresses.  Once a lease has
       expired, the client to which that lease was assigned is no longer  per-
       mitted to use the leased IP address.

       In  order  to  keep  track  of  leases across system reboots and server
       restarts, dhcpd  keeps  a  list  of  leases  it  has  assigned  in  the
       dhcpd.leases(5)  file.    Before  dhcpd  grants  a  lease to a host, it
       records the lease in this file and makes sure that the contents of  the
       file  are  flushed  to disk.   This ensures that even in the event of a
       system crash, dhcpd will not forget about a lease that it has assigned.
       On  startup,  after  reading  the  dhcpd.conf  file,  dhcpd  reads  the
       dhcpd.leases file to refresh its memory about  what  leases  have  been
       assigned.

       New leases are appended to the end of the dhcpd.leases file.   In order
       to prevent the file from becoming arbitrarily large, from time to  time
       dhcpd  creates a new dhcpd.leases file from its in-core lease database.
       Once this file has been written  to  disk,  the  old  file  is  renamed
       _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s_~,  and the new file is renamed dhcpd.leases.   If the sys-
       tem crashes in the middle of this process, whichever dhcpd.leases  file
       remains will contain all the lease information, so there is no need for
       a special crash recovery process.

       BOOTP support is also provided by this server.  Unlike DHCP, the  BOOTP
       protocol  does  not  provide  a  protocol  for  recovering dynamically-
       assigned addresses once they are no longer needed.   It is still possi-
       ble to dynamically assign addresses to BOOTP clients, but some adminis-
       trative process for reclaiming addresses  is  required.    By  default,
       leases are granted to BOOTP clients in perpetuity, although the network
       administrator may set an earlier cutoff date or a shorter lease  length
       for BOOTP leases if that makes sense.

       BOOTP  clients  may also be served in the old standard way, which is to
       simply provide a declaration in the  dhcpd.conf  file  for  each  BOOTP
       client, permanently assigning an address to each client.

       Whenever  changes  are  made  to  the  dhcpd.conf  file,  dhcpd must be
       restarted.   To restart dhcpd, send a SIGTERM (signal 15) to  the  pro-
       cess  ID  contained  in  _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_d_h_c_p_d_._p_i_d,  and then re-invoke dhcpd.
       Because the DHCP server database is  not  as  lightweight  as  a  BOOTP
       database,  dhcpd  does  not automatically restart itself when it sees a
       change to the dhcpd.conf file.

       Note: We get a lot of complaints about this.   We realize that it would
       be nice if one could send a SIGHUP to the server and have it reload the
       database.   This is not technically impossible, but it would require  a
       great  deal  of work, our resources are extremely limited, and they can
       be better spent elsewhere.   So please don’t complain about this on the
       mailing list unless you’re prepared to fund a project to implement this
       feature, or prepared to do it yourself.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD LLIINNEE
       The names of the network interfaces on which dhcpd  should  listen  for
       broadcasts  may  be specified on the command line.  This should be done
       on systems where dhcpd is unable to identify non-broadcast  interfaces,
       but should not be required on other systems.  If no interface names are
       specified on the command line dhcpd will identify  all  network  inter-
       faces  which  are up, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if possible,
       and listen for DHCP broadcasts on each interface.

       If dhcpd should listen on a port other than the standard (port 67), the
       --pp  flag  may  used.   It  should be followed by the udp port number on
       which dhcpd should listen.  This is mostly useful  for  debugging  pur-
       poses.

       To run dhcpd as a foreground process, rather than allowing it to run as
       a daemon in the background, the --ff flag should be specified.   This  is
       useful  when  running dhcpd under a debugger, or when running it out of
       inittab on System V systems.

       To have dhcpd log to the standard  error  descriptor,  specify  the  --dd
       flag.  This can be useful for debugging, and also at sites where a com-
       plete log of all dhcp activity must be kept but syslogd is not reliable
       or  otherwise  cannot  be  used.    Normally, dhcpd will log all output
       using the syslog(3) function with the log facility set  to  LOG_DAEMON.
       Note that -d implies -f (the daemon will not fork itself into the back-
       ground).

       Dhcpd can be made to use an alternate configuration file with  the  --ccff
       flag,  an  alternate  lease file with the --llff flag, or an alternate pid
       file with the --ppff flag.   Because of the importance of using  the  same
       lease  database  at  all  times when running dhcpd in production, these
       options should be used oonnllyy for testing lease files or  database  files
       in a non-production environment.

       When starting dhcpd up from a system startup script (e.g., /etc/rc), it
       may not be desirable to print  out  the  entire  copyright  message  on
       startup.    To  avoid  printing this message, the --qq flag may be speci-
       fied.

       The DHCP server reads two files on startup: a configuration file, and a
       lease  database.    If the --tt flag is specified, the server will simply
       test the configuration file for correct syntax, but will not attempt to
       perform  any  network  operations.   This can be used to test the a new
       configuration file automatically before installing it.

       The --TT flag can be used to test the lease database file  in  a  similar
       way.

       The  --ttff  and  --ppllaayy options allow you to specify a file into which the
       entire startup state of the server and all  the  transactions  it  pro-
       cesses  are  either  logged or played back from.  This can be useful in
       submitting bug reports - if you are getting a core dump every so often,
       you  can start the server with the --ttff option and then, when the server
       dumps core, the trace file will contain all the transactions  that  led
       up  to it dumping core, so that the problem can be easily debugged with
       --ppllaayy.

       The --ppllaayy option must be specified with an alternate lease file,  using
       the  --llff switch, so that the DHCP server doesn’t wipe out your existing
       lease file with its test data.  The DHCP server will refuse to  operate
       in playback mode unless you specify an alternate lease file.

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       The  syntax  of  the dhcpd.conf(5) file is discussed separately.   This
       section should be used as an overview of the configuration process, and
       the dhcpd.conf(5) documentation should be consulted for detailed refer-
       ence information.


SSuubbnneettss
       dhcpd needs to know the subnet numbers and netmasks of all subnets  for
       which  it will be providing service.   In addition, in order to dynami-
       cally allocate addresses, it must be assigned one  or  more  ranges  of
       addresses on each subnet which it can in turn assign to client hosts as
       they boot.   Thus, a very simple configuration providing  DHCP  support
       might look like this:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
            }

       Multiple address ranges may be specified like this:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
              range 239.252.197.113 239.252.197.250;
            }

       If  a  subnet  will  only be provided with BOOTP service and no dynamic
       address assignment, the range clause can be left out entirely, but  the
       subnet statement must appear.


LLeeaassee LLeennggtthhss
       DHCP  leases  can  be  assigned  almost any length from zero seconds to
       infinity.   What lease length makes sense for any given subnet, or  for
       any given installation, will vary depending on the kinds of hosts being
       served.

       For example, in an office environment where systems are added from time
       to  time  and  removed  from  time  to time, but move relatively infre-
       quently, it might make sense to allow lease times of a month  of  more.
       In  a final test environment on a manufacturing floor, it may make more
       sense to assign a maximum lease length of 30 minutes - enough  time  to
       go  through a simple test procedure on a network appliance before pack-
       aging it up for delivery.

       It is possible to specify two lease lengths: the  default  length  that
       will  be  assigned  if  a  client  doesn’t ask for any particular lease
       length, and a maximum lease length.   These are specified as clauses to
       the subnet command:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107;
              default-lease-time 600;
              max-lease-time 7200;
            }

       This  particular  subnet  declaration specifies a default lease time of
       600 seconds (ten minutes), and a maximum lease  time  of  7200  seconds
       (two  hours).    Other  common  values would be 86400 (one day), 604800
       (one week) and 2592000 (30 days).

       Each subnet need not have the same lease—in the case of an office envi-
       ronment and a manufacturing environment served by the same DHCP server,
       it might make sense to have widely disparate  values  for  default  and
       maximum lease times on each subnet.

BBOOOOTTPP SSuuppppoorrtt
       Each  BOOTP  client must be explicitly declared in the dhcpd.conf file.
       A very basic client declaration will specify the client network  inter-
       face’s  hardware  address  and the IP address to assign to that client.
       If the client needs to be able to load a boot  file  from  the  server,
       that file’s name must be specified.   A simple bootp client declaration
       might look like this:

            host haagen {
              hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
              fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
              filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot";
            }

OOppttiioonnss
       DHCP (and also  BOOTP  with  Vendor  Extensions)  provide  a  mechanism
       whereby the server can provide the client with information about how to
       configure its network interface (e.g., subnet mask), and also  how  the
       client  can access various network services (e.g., DNS, IP routers, and
       so on).

       These options can be specified on a per-subnet basis,  and,  for  BOOTP
       clients, also on a per-client basis.   In the event that a BOOTP client
       declaration specifies options that are also  specified  in  its  subnet
       declaration,  the  options  specified  in  the  client declaration take
       precedence.   A reasonably complete DHCP configuration might look some-
       thing like this:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;
              default-lease-time 600 max-lease-time 7200;
              option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
              option broadcast-address 239.252.197.255;
              option routers 239.252.197.1;
              option domain-name-servers 239.252.197.2, 239.252.197.3;
              option domain-name "isc.org";
            }

       A  bootp host on that subnet that needs to be in a different domain and
       use a different name server might be declared as follows:

            host haagen {
              hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23;
              fixed-address 239.252.197.9;
              filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot";
              option domain-name-servers 192.5.5.1;
              option domain-name "vix.com";
            }

       A more complete description of the dhcpd.conf file syntax  is  provided
       in dhcpd.conf(5).

OOMMAAPPII
       The  DHCP server provides the capability to modify some of its configu-
       ration while it is running, without stopping it, modifying its database
       files,  and restarting it.  This capability is currently provided using
       OMAPI - an API for manipulating remote objects.  OMAPI clients  connect
       to  the  server  using  TCP/IP,  authenticate, and can then examine the
       server’s current status and make changes to it.

       Rather than implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol  directly,  user
       programs  should  use  the  dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself.   Dhcpctl is a
       wrapper that handles some of the housekeeping chores  that  OMAPI  does
       not  do automatically.   Dhcpctl and OMAPI are documented in ddhhccppccttll((33))
       and oommaappii((33)).

       OMAPI exports objects, which can then be examined and  modified.    The
       DHCP  server exports the following objects: lease, host, failover-state
       and group.   Each object has a number of  methods  that  are  provided:
       lookup,  create,  and destroy.   In addition, it is possible to look at
       attributes that are stored on objects, and  in  some  cases  to  modify
       those attributes.

       Leases  can’t currently be created or destroyed, but they can be looked

            value  is  undefined).   Generally this value is only adjusted for
            expired, released, or reset leases while the server  is  operating
            in  partner-down state, and otherwise is simply the value supplied
            by the peer.

       Hosts can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined and modified.   If
       a  host declaration is created or deleted using OMAPI, that information
       will be recorded in the  dhcpd.leases  file.    It  is  permissible  to
       delete host declarations that are declared in the dhcpd.conf file.

       Hosts have the following attributes:

       nnaammee _d_a_t_a lookup, examine, modify
            the name of the host declaration.   This name must be unique among
            all host declarations.

            a  fixed  IP  address  which  is  reserved  for a DHCP client that

            assigned  to  the client if it is valid for the network segment to
            which the client is connected.

            will  be  treated  as  _k_n_o_w_n  in pool permit lists.   If zero, the
            client will not be treated as known.

       Named groups can be created, destroyed, looked up, examined  and  modi-
       fied.   If  a group declaration is created or deleted using OMAPI, that
       information will be recorded in the dhcpd.leases file.  It is permissi-
       ble  to  delete  group declarations that are declared in the dhcpd.conf
       file.

       Named groups currently can only be associated with hosts - this  allows
       one  set of statements to be efficiently attached to more than one host
       declaration.

       Groups have the following attributes:

       nnaammee _d_a_t_a
            the name of the group.  All groups that are  created  using  OMAPI
            must have names, and the names must be unique among all groups.

       ssttaatteemmeennttss _d_a_t_a
            a  list  of  statements  in the format of the dhcpd.conf file that
            will be executed whenever a message from a client whose host  dec-
            laration references this group is processed.

       The  control object allows you to shut the server down.   If the server
       is doing failover with another peer, it will make  a  clean  transition
       into  the  shutdown  state and notify its peer, so that the peer can go
       into partner down, and then record the "recover"  state  in  the  lease
       file so that when the server is restarted, it will automatically resyn-
       chronize with its peer.

       On shutdown the server will also attempt to cleanly shut down all OMAPI
       connections.   If  these  connections do not go down cleanly after five
       seconds, they are shut down preemptively.  It can take as  much  as  25
       seconds from the beginning of the shutdown process to the time that the
       server actually exits.

       To shut the server down, open its control  object  and  set  the  state
       attribute to 2.

       The  failover-state  object  is the object that tracks the state of the
       failover protocol as it is being managed for  a  given  failover  peer.

            Indicates the TCP port on which the failover partner is  listening
            for failover protocol connections.

       llooccaall--ppoorrtt _d_a_t_a examine

            relationship.

       llooccaall--ssttaattee _i_n_t_e_g_e_r examine, modify
            Indicates the present state of the DHCP server  in  this  failover
            relationship.   Possible values for state are:

                 1  - partner down
                 2  - normal
                 3  - communications interrupted
                 4  - resolution interrupted
                 5  - potential conflict
                 6  - recover
                 7  - recover done
                 8  - shutdown
                 9  - paused
                 10 - startup
                 11 - recover wait

            In  general  it  is not a good idea to make changes to this state.
            However, in the case that the failover  partner  is  known  to  be
            down,  it can be useful to set the DHCP server’s failover state to
            partner down.   At this point the DHCP server will take over  ser-
            vice  of  the  failover  partner’s leases as soon as possible, and
            will give out normal leases, not leases  that  are  restricted  by
            MCLT.    If  you do put the DHCP server into the partner-down when
            the other DHCP server is not in the partner-down state, but is not
            reachable,  IP  address  assignment  conflicts  are possible, even
            likely.   Once a server has been put into partner-down  mode,  its
            failover  partner must not be brought back online until communica-
            tion is possible between the two servers.
